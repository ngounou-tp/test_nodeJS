***     ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS ***
2.1 EXPLANATION OF WORK
- The reason why i structured my code this was is because tu many factors and the first being the mvc approach where considerations should be taken for the separation of codes into models, views and controllers and the easiest way to implement this was this way, another reason of my choice of this file structure is my wish to use node js namespace that permit it to easily identified each file and the last reason because of my project size wish is not big
- In production i will use the same approach depending on my project size, whether am working alone on the project or working in a team because i will try as much as possible to optimize my code and structure such that every part should be easily identifiable in case an error occur

2.2 CODE REVIEW
- The key word function could be remove from the first line because it is not very usefull javascript already know it is an anonymous function the is no need for the precision
-async and awit should could also added because there is an asynchronous call to db.addUser
-also a try and catch block could be also added before excutiong the call to db.addUser because the action may raise and exception that can be handle

3. TIME MANAGEMENT PART
According to the scenario being given i have to plan in a week how i will prioritise and handle the excution of the following task in a week:
    1. Fix a critical bug in the login module.
    2. Develop a new feature that has been highly requested by clients.
    3. Document the API you developed in Task1. 
    4. Optimize the database queries in an existing module.

    The order and timeline of excution i would use will be as follows
    - exucute task 1 for in the first day because for me it is a high priority task especially if the application is already in production it may hinder users from accessing the system and may also cause lost of information. SO
    - excute task 3 in half of the second day because it is very important to document a work after completing it as soon as possible especially when it concerns a security issue inorder to know what cause the problems and solution to solve it
    -the second half of the second day will be to call execute a part of task 2 wich is to called the clients and gather it requirements for the feature i should develop once done i will do the planification for the development of the module
    and start the development the next day
    -once am through with all the other task i will then do task 4 because optimizing the database is not a priority task if the actual database does not have any issue for that moment
